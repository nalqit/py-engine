# PyEngine 2D

PyEngine 2D is a lightweight, purely Python-based 2D game engine built with **Pygame**, inspired by Godot's scene and node system. It focuses on architectural clarity, explicit systems, and educational value.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is an experimental prototype focusing on learning and extensibility rather than raw performance.

## 🟢 System Status

The engine is built using a **layered architecture**, with each level stabilized before the next is added.

| Level | Layer                      | Status |
| :---: | :------------------------- | :----: |
|   0   | Runtime Core               |   ✅   |
|   1   | Scene System               |   ✅   |
|   2   | Collision System           |   ✅   |
|   3   | Physics Layer              |   ✅   |
|   4   | Gameplay Layer             |   ✅   |
|   5   | State Layer (FSM)          |   ✅   |
|   6   | Juice & Animation Layer    |   ✅   |

### Level 0 — Runtime Core
- Game loop, delta timing, base `Node` class, scene tree hierarchy.

### Level 1 — Scene System
- Parent/child transform propagation, local vs global position, update lifecycle.

### Level 2 — Collision System
- **Collider2D**: Scale-aware AABB data — dimensions, layer/mask, static/trigger flags.
- **CollisionResult**: Structured dataclass with collision normal and penetration depth.
- **CollisionWorld**: Float-precision AABB overlap checks with MTV resolution. Layer/mask filtering, trigger support, and epsilon-inclusive edge detection.

### Level 3 — Physics Layer
- **PhysicsBody2D**: Generic body with per-axis move-and-collide float-precision resolution.
- **Gravity**: Engine-level `use_gravity` flag with configurable `gravity` constant.
- **Impulses**: `apply_impulse(ix, iy)` for instantaneous velocity changes.
- **Coordinate-Space Consistency**: Precise conversion between local and global spaces during resolution.

### Level 4 — Gameplay Layer
- **PlayerController**: Engine-agnostic controller that maps abstract input to physics intentions.
- **Movement**: Acceleration-based horizontal movement with friction and max speed clamping.
- **Ground Detection**: Non-invasive pure probe check (downward offset) via `CollisionWorld`.

### Level 5 — State Layer (FSM)
- **PlayerStateMachine**: Manages behavioral states (Idle, Run, Jump, Fall).
- **Lightweight States**: Concrete state objects (`IdleState`, `RunState`, etc.).

### Level 6 — Juice & Animation Layer
- **Tween System**: Powerful property interpolation with Easing functions for smooth "Juice."
- **Particle System**: `ParticleEmitter2D` for visual effects like jump dust or sparks.
- **Sprite Animation**: `SpriteNode` for static assets and `AnimatedSprite` for frame-based sheets.
- **Parallax Backgrounds**: Multi-layered backgrounds for environmental depth.

## ✨ Core Architecture

### 🍭 Juice & Feel (Level 6)
- **Tweening Engine**: Smoothly animate any property (scale, position, alpha) using `TweenManager`.
- **Scale-Aware Hitboxes**: Physics and Collisions automatically adapt when objects squash or stretch.
- **Visual Polish**: Procedural effects (bobbing coins, landing dust) integrated directly into game logic.

### 🎮 Gameplay & Control (Levels 4-5)
- **Engine-Agnostic Controllers**: The `PlayerController` does not import `pygame`, receiving an abstract `input_state` dictionary instead.
- **Finite State Machine**: Decouples "what the player is doing" from "how the player moves."

### ⚙️ Physics & Collision (Levels 2-3)
- **Axis-Separated Resolution**: X is resolved, then Y, with forced transform synchronization between steps.
- **Coordinate Integrity**: Robust handling of local-to-global translations to prevent "teleportation" glitches.
- **Float Precision**: Uses exact float boundaries and inclusive epsilon bounds for reliable contact detection (e.g., box pushing, springs).
